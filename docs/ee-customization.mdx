# Using your own End-Effector

OpenArm v1.0 design is flexible and allows you to easily attach your own custom end-effector (e.g., grippers, cameras, tools) with minimal changes to the existing structure.

---

## 🔄 What Needs to Change?

To mount a different end-effector, all you need to do is **replace the part `J8_B`**. This part acts as the interface between the robotic arm and the end-effector.

Your custom `J8_B` should:

- Match the hole pattern and dimensions of the original for seamless integration.
- Include mounting features that match your end-effector's design.
- Maintain mechanical strength and alignment.

## 📂 Reference Files

To help you design your own `J8_B`, we provide downloadable CAD files.

These files can be imported into most CAD software and serve as a starting point for customization.

## 🧠 Design Considerations

When creating your custom `J8_B`, keep the following in mind:

- **Mounting Alignment**: Ensure that the center of mass and torque loads are balanced relative to the arm’s axis.
- **Cable Management**: Add holes, channels, or clips for clean wiring if your end-effector needs power or signals.
- **Manufacturability**: Keep the design simple enough for 3D printing or CNC machining.
