title: Installation

This installation guide provides instructions for setting up the leader-follower configuration of the OpenArm v1.0 system. The leader and follower systems are physically identical, with the only distinction being the end-effector configuration.

## Power 
1. Each of the four arms (two leaders and two followers) is powered by its own dedicated power supply.  
2. The system includes two emergency stop (E-stop) buttons â€” one for the leader pair and one for the follower pair.  
3. Connect the power supplies of the two follower arms to a single E-stop button. Repeat the same process for the leader arms, ensuring that each pair is connected to its designated E-stop.  
4. The two output cables from each E-stop should be connected to the corresponding hubs of the arms.

## Communication
For the USB-to-CAN converters, assign the CAN IDs as follows:  
- CAN ID 0: Right Leader  
- CAN ID 1: Left Leader 
- CAN ID 2: Right Follower  
- CAN ID 3: Left Follower  

Connect the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>**red wires**</span> to <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>**CANH**</span> and the **black wires** to **CANL**. Then, plug each CAN connector into the hub of the corresponding arm.
