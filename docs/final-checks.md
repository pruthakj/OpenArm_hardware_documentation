# âœ… Final Checks

Before powering on or using the robotic arm, go through the following final checks to ensure safe and correct operation.

---

## ðŸ”© Mechanical Inspection

- [ ] All bolts and fasteners are securely tightened.
- [ ] No visible misalignment in joints or links.
- [ ] All mechanical parts are installed in the correct orientation.
- [ ] The arm can move freely through its range without interference.
- [ ] Bearings and joints move smoothly (no grinding or resistance).

---

## ðŸ”Œ Electrical Connections

- [ ] All motors, sensors, and power cables are connected correctly.
- [ ] Connectors are fully inserted and locked (no loose cables).
- [ ] No pinched or stressed wiresâ€”check for proper cable routing.

---

## ðŸ§  Software & Firmware Setup

- [ ] Firmware is flashed on all actuators and verified.
- [ ] Each motor is assigned a correct and unique CAN ID.
- [ ] Controller or PC can communicate with the actuators successfully.
- [ ] Drivers and communication libraries are installed and configured.

---

## ðŸ§¯ Safety Checks

- [ ] The robotic arm is securely fastened to a stable base or mounting platform.
- [ ] An **emergency stop button** is available and within reach during operation.
- [ ] There are **no obstructions** around the armâ€™s range of motion.
- [ ] All users are at a **safe distance** during power-up and movement.
- [ ] Cables are **neatly routed** to avoid entanglement or contact with moving parts.
- [ ] No flammable materials are placed near the robot or power supply.

## ðŸ”„ Power-On Sequence

Follow this sequence to safely power on the robotic arm:

1. Ensure all mechanical and electrical checks are complete.
2. Connect the main **power supply**, but do **not enable the motors** yet.
3. Launch your control software or terminal tool.
4. Confirm communication with all actuators or devices.
5. Enable the motors or send an initialization command.
6. Slowly move **one joint at a time** using low-speed commands.
7. Observe for:
   - Unexpected vibrations
   - Unusual sounds
   - Overheating or delay
8. If everything behaves as expected, proceed to run more complex sequences.
